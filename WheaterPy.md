## WheaterPy

The aim is to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world at varying distances from the equator. The data were randomly selected from [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), where detailed information about cities and their latitude, longitude, maximum temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed, country, and a date was retrieved.

The first objective is to build a series of scatter plots to show the following relationships:<br>
<ul>
<li>Temperature (F) vs. Latitude</li>
<li>Humidity (%) vs. Latitude</li>
<li>Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude</li>
<li>Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude</li>
</ul>

The second objective is to run a linear regression on each relationship separating them into Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere
<ul>
<li>Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude</li>
<li>Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude</li>
<li>Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude</li>
<li>Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude</li>
<li>Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude</li>
<li>Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude</li>
<li>Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude</li>
<li>Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude</li>
</ul>
